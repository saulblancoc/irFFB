# irFFB2022


irFFB2022 is an update to irFFB that is found on the nlp80/irffb github repository that was last updated sometime in 2020.  The irFFB2022 version keeps the core internals as in the original version of irFFB, but simplifies the configuration and controls of irFFB so that users can optimize their settings for their car and track.   The key objective was to make irFFB easy to understand and easy to use. As a result, you will find it much easier to optimize your FFB experience in iRacing and achieve most consistent lap times over a longer period of time.  For those NextGen Cup racers, you may even find yourself recovering from those dreaded snap spins. It was those snap spins that got me to come back and take a new look at irFFB.

New Features:

•	Easy to Understand Modes

•	Automatic -360 Smoothing Mode for a blend of Low Latency and Telemetry Enhancements

•	Previous “Offsets” were modified and presented as “Effect Timings” in a simple single control slider

•	SoP renamed to Oversteer to make it easier to understand

•	Understeer enabled for all cars and easily configured with a slider

•	Car and Track combinations are saved together to reduce configure a car for a track

Two guides are posted in the release link:

The TL;DR (aka Short Version) and the Long version.  I attached those so you can use them as reference.

I would like to stress that you run irFFB2022 (and irFFB) before you launch into a sim session.  It really does not like to start after the session.  Maybe a fix for that at a later date.
